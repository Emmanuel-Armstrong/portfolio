ABOUT:

This is the git repository that contains programs that I wrote 
and helped write to give an idea of my programming skills.

Some of these programs were programs written for an Artificial Intelligence class with two other students.  
We all contributed to the code writing and we worked together to come up with the solutions to the logical problems at hand.
